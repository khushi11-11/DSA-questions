2-D ARRAY~

- have more than one dimension.
- syntax is very simple : data_type[row][column] array = new data_type[5][];
- row size, to be mentioned, is mandatory in java. Column size is not required.
- example : int[][] arr = {
                            { 1, 2, 3},
                            { 4, 5, 6},
                            { 7, 8, 9}
            };

- every element of 'arr', here, is an array itself. Array of arrays !!

*DYNAMIC ARRAY*
- column is of variable length, i.e., every row can have a different size of elements
- it can look like this also => { {1,2,3}, {4,5}, {6,7,8,9,10} }
- aka jagged array
- arr.length, in case of 2d arrays, will return the row length
