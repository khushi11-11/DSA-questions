QUES. why does an unset reference variable of type string array returns null when accessed but returns 0 when the array object is of type int, in Java?

ANS. This behavior is due to how Java initializes reference variables versus primitive data type (int) arrays.

In Java, when you declare a reference variable (String - an object type), but don't explicitly initialize it, its default value is 'null'.
but when you declare an array of primitive types (int[]), Java automatically initializes all its elements with their default values.
default value for unset variables of an int type of object is 0.

=> String[] is an array of references, and references default to null.
=> int[] is an array of primitive values, and primitive int defaults to 0.

* Primitives are stored in stack.
* Objects are stored in heap memory.
