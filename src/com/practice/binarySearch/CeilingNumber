CEILING NUMBER~

- smallest num >= target
- e.g. array = {2,3,5,9,12,14,16,20}
    target = 15
    ceiling no.= 16 : greater than (or equal to) 15 => 16, 20
                      smallest of them => 16

    target = 14 : ceiling no. = 14


- at some point (typically at the end), there will be condition where start and end is equal
- the ans is either that mid which is basically = start = end
- so if mid is not the ans then it must be the next element
- the next iteration after start=end => results to start>end
- start will be end+1 & end remains same
- so the answer is start

- same for descending ordered array where ans will be end
