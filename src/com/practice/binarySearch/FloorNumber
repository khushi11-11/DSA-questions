FLOOR NUMBER~

- largest num <= target
- e.g. array = {2,3,5,9,12,14,16,20}
    target = 15
    floor no.= 14 : smaller than (or equal to) 15 => 2,3,5,9,12,14
                      largest of them => 14

    target = 14 : floor no. = 14

- for when the target element does not exist in the array?
    > this means the while loop will have to break as there is no such element
    > this results in start > end
    > bcoz we need to find the number which is smaller than the target, we will return element at index end
    > why end? this is bcoz if mid of the array (last itr-n) is not the ans it has to be the previous one
    > why prev one? bcoz floor is smaller than target
    > also out of all the numbers smaller than the target, floor is the largest one
    > that means the number just previous to the mid is the floor
